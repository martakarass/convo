Description: Provides methods for fast computation of running (aka rolling) 
    sample statistics. These include running sample mean of a 
    single numeric sequence, running sample variance of a single numeric 
    sequence, running sample covariance of two numeric sequences. 
    Implementation of the methods uses convolution via Fast Fourier 
    Transform. From Convolution Theorem, the complexity of the 
    convolution can be reduced from O(n^{2}) to O(n\log n) 
    with fast Fourier transform compared to conventional computation.
